My program is coded to adhere to all the requirements of this first assignment. All the sample inputs produced the
same sample outputs as given by the professor. The only non-standard libraries that may have been used are: 
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <math.h>

Other than this, all other #include files are the 4 header files, one for each of the .c files. 

The following are all the necessary files for this program:

cs3421_emul.h
cs3421_cpu.h
cs3421_memory.h
cs3421_clock.h
cs3421_emul.c
cs3421_cpu.c
cs3421_memory.c
cs3421_clock.c

A makefile has been included with the submission.
